# Newport Robotic Group's Lab on Git

The purpose of this repository is to serve as an activity programming rookies can do to practice familiarize themselves with Git.

## How to Start

There are two separate "labs," which cover the basics of Git\
Instructions to complete these two labs are here:

- [Lab 1: Creating A Local & Remote Repository](CreatingARemoteRepo/instructions.md)
- [Lab 2: Practicing Commits & Branches](PracticingCommitsAndBranches/instructions.md)

Note: labs should be completed in order, so that instructions make sense
